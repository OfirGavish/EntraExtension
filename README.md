# Entra ID Group Membership Manager Extension by MSCloudNinja

## Overview
This Microsoft Edge extension allows Microsoft Entra (Azure AD) administrators to efficiently copy group memberships from one user to another using the Microsoft Graph API. Built with modern OAuth 2.0 + PKCE authentication for maximum security.

**Browser Compatibility**: Primarily designed for Microsoft Edge, but also compatible with Chrome and other Chromium-based browsers.

## ✨ Features
- **🔐 Secure OAuth 2.0 + PKCE Authentication** - Modern, secure authentication flow

- **📊 Intelligent Group Filtering** - Automatically filters out non-manageable groups:
  - Dynamic groups (membership rules)
  - Mail-enabled security groups
  - Distribution lists
- **✅ Pre-flight Membership Checks** - Prevents duplicate membership errors
- **📈 Detailed Status Reporting** - Shows success, failure, and skip counts with detailed error messages
- **🛡️ Multi-tenant Support** - Works across different Azure AD tenants
- **🔍 Admin Role Detection** - Validates admin permissions before operations
- **🎯 Group Type Classification** - Clearly identifies Security Groups, Office 365 Groups, and Teams

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Microsoft Edge browser (or Chrome/other Chromium-based browsers)
- Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD) admin account with one of these roles:
  - Global Administrator
  - User Administrator
  - Groups Administrator
  - Application Administrator
  - Security Administrator
  - Helpdesk Administrator

### 1. Install the Extension
1. Download or clone this repository
2. Open Microsoft Edge and go to `edge://extensions` (or `chrome://extensions` for Chrome)
3. Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in bottom left for Edge, top right for Chrome)
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the `EntraExtension` folder
5. Note the Extension ID that appears (you'll need this for Azure setup)

### 2. Create Azure AD App Registration

1. **Go to Azure Portal** → [App registrations](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_RegisteredApps/ApplicationsListBlade)

2. **Click "New registration"**
   - **Name**: `Group Membership Copier` (or your preferred name)
   - **Supported account types**: `Accounts in this organizational directory only` (single tenant)
   - **Redirect URI**: 
     - Platform: `Single-page application (SPA)`
     - URI: `https://YOUR_EXTENSION_ID.chromiumapp.org/`
     - Replace `YOUR_EXTENSION_ID` with the actual extension ID from step 1

3. **Click "Register"**

4. **Copy the Application (client) ID** - you'll need this for the extension settings

### 3. Configure API Permissions

1. **In your app registration**, go to **"API permissions"**

2. **Click "Add a permission"** → **Microsoft Graph** → **Delegated permissions**

3. **Add these permissions**:
   ```
   User.Read                    # Read user profile
   User.ReadBasic.All          # Read basic user info
   User.Read.All               # Read all user profiles  
   Group.Read.All              # Read all groups
   GroupMember.ReadWrite.All   # Manage group memberships
   Directory.Read.All          # Read directory (for admin role detection)
   ```

4. **Click "Grant admin consent"** for your organization
   - ⚠️ **Important**: Admin consent is required for the extension to work

### 4. Configure the Extension

1. **Click the extension icon** in Chrome
2. **Click the "Settings" button** 
3. **Enter your Client ID** (from step 2.4)
4. **Click "Save Settings"**
5. **Click "Sign In"** and complete the OAuth flow

## 📖 How to Use

### Copying Group Memberships

1. **Sign in** using the extension popup
2. **Enter source user** email/UPN in the "Source User" field
3. **Click "Fetch Groups"** to load their group memberships
4. **Review the groups** - the extension automatically:
   - ✅ Shows manageable groups (Security Groups, Office 365 Groups, Teams)
   - ❌ Filters out dynamic groups, distribution lists, and mail-enabled security groups
5. **Select/deselect** groups as needed (all manageable groups are selected by default)
6. **Enter target user** email/UPN in the "Target User" field  
7. **Click "Copy Selected Groups"**
8. **Review results** - the extension shows:
   - ✅ Successfully copied groups
   - ⏭️ Skipped groups (user already a member)
   - ❌ Failed groups with detailed error messages

### Group Type Indicators

- **Security Group** - Azure AD security groups
- **Office 365 Group** - Microsoft 365 groups with email
- **Office 365 Team** - Microsoft Teams without email
- **Mail Group** - Legacy mail-enabled groups

### Understanding the Results

The extension provides detailed feedback:
- **Green**: All operations successful
- **Orange**: Some failures occurred (check details)
- **Blue**: Information messages
- **Red**: Critical errors

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Architecture
- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code flow with PKCE
- **API**: Microsoft Graph API v1.0
- **Extension Type**: Chrome Extension Manifest V3
- **Background**: Service Worker for token management
- **Frontend**: HTML/CSS/JavaScript popup interface

### Security Features
- ✅ **PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange)** - Prevents authorization code interception
- ✅ **Token refresh** - Automatic token renewal without re-authentication
- ✅ **Secure storage** - Tokens stored securely in Chrome extension storage
- ✅ **Admin validation** - Verifies admin roles before allowing operations
- ✅ **Pre-flight checks** - Validates membership before attempting operations

### Smart Filtering Logic
The extension intelligently filters groups to show only those that support manual membership management:

**✅ Included Groups:**
- Security Groups (`securityEnabled: true, mailEnabled: false`)
- Office 365 Groups (`groupTypes: ["Unified"], mailEnabled: true`)
- Microsoft Teams (`groupTypes: ["Unified"], mailEnabled: false`)

**❌ Excluded Groups:**
- Dynamic groups (have `membershipRule` and `membershipRuleProcessingState: "On"`)
- Mail-enabled security groups (`mailEnabled: true AND securityEnabled: true`)
- Distribution lists (`mailEnabled: true` without `groupTypes: ["Unified"]`)

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Not signed in" or Authentication Errors
- Ensure you've completed the Azure AD app registration setup
- Verify the Client ID is correct in extension settings
- Check that admin consent has been granted for API permissions
- Try signing out and back in

#### "You must be an admin" Error
- Verify your account has one of the required admin roles
- Check the debug information shown when fetching groups
- Ensure `Directory.Read.All` permission is granted and consented

#### Groups Not Appearing
- The extension filters out non-manageable groups by design
- Dynamic groups, distribution lists, and mail-enabled security groups are excluded
- Check the console logs for filtering details

#### Permission Errors When Copying Groups
- Verify `GroupMember.ReadWrite.All` permission is granted
- Ensure admin consent has been provided
- Some groups may have additional restrictions based on group settings

### Debug Information
The extension shows detailed debug information when fetching groups, including:
- Your admin roles and permissions
- Group filtering logic and results
- Detailed error messages for troubleshooting
