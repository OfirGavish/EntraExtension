   User.Read.All               # Read all user profiles  
   Group.Read.All              # Read all groups
   GroupMember.ReadWrite.All   # Manage group memberships
   Directory.Read.All          # Read directory (for admin role detection)
   ```

4. **Click "Grant admin consent"** for your organization
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Admin consent is required for the extension to work

### 4. Configure the Extension

1. **Click the extension icon** in Chrome

## üìñ How to Use

### Copying Group Memberships

1. **Sign in** using the extension popup
2. **Enter source user** email/UPN in the "Source User" field
3. **Click "Fetch Groups"** to load their group memberships
4. **Review the groups** - the extension automatically:
   - ‚úÖ Shows manageable groups (Security Groups, Office 365 Groups, Teams)
   - ‚ùå Filters out dynamic groups, distribution lists, and mail-enabled security groups
5. **Select/deselect** groups as needed (all manageable groups are selected by default)
6. **Enter target user** email/UPN in the "Target User" field  
7. **Click "Copy Selected Groups"**
8. **Review results** - the extension shows:
   - ‚úÖ Successfully copied groups
   - ‚è≠Ô∏è Skipped groups (user already a member)
   - ‚ùå Failed groups with detailed error messages

### Group Type Indicators

- **Security Group** - Azure AD security groups
- **Office 365 Group** - Microsoft 365 groups with email
- **Office 365 Team** - Microsoft Teams without email
- **Mail Group** - Legacy mail-enabled groups

### Understanding the Results

The extension provides detailed feedback:
- **Green**: All operations successful
- **Orange**: Some failures occurred (check details)
- **Blue**: Information messages
- **Red**: Critical errors

## üîß Technical Details

### Architecture
- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code flow with PKCE
- **API**: Microsoft Graph API v1.0
- **Extension Type**: Chrome Extension Manifest V3
- **Background**: Service Worker for token management
- **Frontend**: HTML/CSS/JavaScript popup interface

### Security Features
- ‚úÖ **PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange)** - Prevents authorization code interception
- ‚úÖ **Token refresh** - Automatic token renewal without re-authentication
- ‚úÖ **Secure storage** - Tokens stored securely in Chrome extension storage
- ‚úÖ **Admin validation** - Verifies admin roles before allowing operations
- ‚úÖ **Pre-flight checks** - Validates membership before attempting operations

### Smart Filtering Logic
The extension intelligently filters groups to show only those that support manual membership management:

**‚úÖ Included Groups:**
- Security Groups (`securityEnabled: true, mailEnabled: false`)
- Office 365 Groups (`groupTypes: ["Unified"], mailEnabled: true`)
- Microsoft Teams (`groupTypes: ["Unified"], mailEnabled: false`)

**‚ùå Excluded Groups:**
- Dynamic groups (have `membershipRule` and `membershipRuleProcessingState: "On"`)
- Mail-enabled security groups (`mailEnabled: true AND securityEnabled: true`)
- Distribution lists (`mailEnabled: true` without `groupTypes: ["Unified"]`)

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Not signed in" or Authentication Errors
- Ensure you've completed the Azure AD app registration setup
- Verify the Client ID is correct in extension settings
- Check that admin consent has been granted for API permissions
- Try signing out and back in

#### "You must be an admin" Error
- Verify your account has one of the required admin roles
- Check the debug information shown when fetching groups
- Ensure `Directory.Read.All` permission is granted and consented

#### Groups Not Appearing
- The extension filters out non-manageable groups by design
- Dynamic groups, distribution lists, and mail-enabled security groups are excluded
- Check the console logs for filtering details

#### Permission Errors When Copying Groups
- Verify `GroupMember.ReadWrite.All` permission is granted
- Ensure admin consent has been provided
- Some groups may have additional restrictions based on group settings

### Debug Information
The extension shows detailed debug information when fetching groups, including:
- Your admin roles and permissions
- Group filtering logic and results
- Detailed error messages for troubleshooting
